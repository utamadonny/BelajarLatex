abstract = {Terkadang kita harus meninggalkan rumah dalam keadaan kosong untuk waktu yang lama dan kita sering berpikir untuk menghidupkan lampu di suatu ruangan di rumah kita ketika malam hari dan mematikannya ketika pagi hari. Tekadang kita juga lupa untuk mematikan sebuah alat elektronik ketika kita meninggalkan rumah dan kita tidak memiliki waktu yang cukup untuk kembali dan mematikannya. Kita dapat mengatasi masalah tersebut dengan membangun sebuah smart building. Pada smart building setiap peralatan listrik yang berada di dalamnya dihubungkan ke sebuah perangkat yang dapat memantau dan mengontrol peralatan tersebut. Perangkat tersebut terhubung ke jaringan komputer, sehingga dapat dikendalikan melalui jarak jauh Tugas akhir ini membahas bagaimana merancang dan mengimplementasikan prototipe smart building berbasis arduino uno. Peralatan listrik dihubungkan ke protototipe yang dirancang kemudian dikendalikan melalui aplikasi web browser yang terdapat pada komputer pribadi atau telepon genggam. Arduino Uno adalah arduino board yang menggunakan mikrokontroler ATmega328 sebagai chip utamanya. Arduino uno diprogram menggunakan bahasa pemrograman arduino.},

abstract = {Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the ``tilt'' quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

@article{Ludwig2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. A magnetic and inertial measurement unit (MIMU) usually measures acceleration, rotation rate, and earth's magnetic field in order to determine a body's attitude. In order to find the orientation information using all sensors a fusion algorithm is used. This paper compares two approaches used for a Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), namely Madgwick and Mahony with a basic fusion approach. Foot mounted MIMU data is used to estimate the Euler angles as well as the position. The results show that Madgwick obtains better heading orientation than Mahony and the basic AHRS approach in terms of the error (RMSE) of the Euler angles when compared to the ground truth. However, the execution time of Mahony is less than Madgwick with the basic AHRS taking the longest.},

@article{Hasan2020,
abstract = {In this paper, we proposed an enhanced pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system based on sensor fusion schemes using a smartphone. PDR is an effective technology for 3D indoor navigation. However, still, there are some obstacles to be overcome in its practical application. To track and simulate pedestrian's position, which is confronted by environmental errors, walls, Bayesian errors, and other obstacles, our proposed PDR system enables estimation of stride based on the vertical accelerometer data and orientation from sensor fusion technique of magnetic angular rate and gravity sensor data by Madgwick filter. This locali-zation system is independent of the received signal strength-based fingerprinting system. In addition, to estimate the current floor level, we make use of barometer information. To collect ground truth accurately and efficiently a prototype is implemented with the benchmark. We perform the same distance estimation for four different pedestrians to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system. The real indoor experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system performs well while tracking the test subject in a 2D scenario with low estimation error (< 2 m). The 3D evaluation of the system inside a multi-story building shows that high accuracy can be achieved for a short range of time without position update from external sources. Then we compared localization performance between our proposed system and an existing (extended Kalman filter based) system.},
